generations:
  - name: "First Generation (N140/N150/N160/N170)"
    start_year: 1995
    end_year: 2004
    description: "The first-generation Toyota Tacoma was introduced as Toyota's compact pickup truck for North America, replacing the previous Toyota Pickup (Hilux in other markets) with a design more specifically tailored to American preferences. Available in regular cab, extended cab (Xtracab), and eventually crew cab (DoubleCab) configurations, the original Tacoma featured more car-like comfort, handling, and safety features than its more utilitarian predecessor. Engine options included a 2.4-liter four-cylinder, 2.7-liter four-cylinder, and a 3.4-liter V6, paired with manual or automatic transmissions and either rear-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive with a two-speed transfer case. The interior offered improved comfort and features compared to previous Toyota trucks, though still maintaining a relatively utilitarian character with durable materials. Specialized variants included the PreRunner offering the styling and stance of a four-wheel drive model with rear-wheel drive mechanicals, and the off-road oriented TRD packages featuring upgraded suspension, tires, and appearance elements. Safety features expanded during this generation to include driver and passenger airbags and ABS. This generation established the Tacoma as a leader in the compact truck segment (later reclassified as midsize), known for its reliability, off-road capability, and strong resale value—attributes that would define the nameplate through subsequent generations. The first-generation Tacoma struck a successful balance between the rugged durability expected of a pickup truck and the more civilized driving experience increasingly demanded by American consumers using trucks as daily transportation."

  - name: "Second Generation (N220/N240/N250/N260/N270)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2015
    description: "The second-generation Toyota Tacoma grew significantly larger than its predecessor, reflecting the general market trend toward bigger vehicles and the reclassification of this segment from compact to midsize trucks. Available in regular cab, access cab (extended), and double cab (crew) configurations with both short and long bed options, this generation featured more aggressive styling with a prominent grille, flared fenders, and an overall more substantial presence. Engine options included a 2.7-liter four-cylinder and a 4.0-liter V6 producing 236 horsepower, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior saw improvements in design, material quality, and features, including available touchscreen navigation, premium audio, and enhanced comfort options, though maintaining a relatively utilitarian character appropriate for a work vehicle. Off-road capability remained a priority with multiple four-wheel drive system options, including the advanced TRD Off-Road and TRD Pro packages featuring specialized suspension, all-terrain tires, locking rear differential, and terrain-specific driving modes. Safety features expanded to include side and curtain airbags, stability control, and traction control. A notable innovation was the Composite-Reinforced Cargo Bed made of fiber-reinforced Sheet-Molded Composite (SMC) on the inner bed walls and floor, providing enhanced durability and corrosion resistance while reducing weight. A minor refresh in 2012 brought updated styling with a revised grille and headlights. This generation further cemented the Tacoma's reputation for reliability, capability, and exceptional resale value, helping it dominate the midsize truck segment in North America despite relatively few updates over its extended production run, as most competitors temporarily withdrew from the segment during this period."

  - name: "Third Generation (N300)"
    start_year: 2016
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The third-generation Toyota Tacoma featured more aggressive, angular styling with a bold hexagonal grille, muscular fender flares, and a higher hood line, maintaining its rugged identity while adopting more modern design elements. Available exclusively in access cab and double cab configurations (the regular cab was discontinued), with short and long bed options, this generation continued to target both work and recreational users. Engine options included a 2.7-liter four-cylinder and a more advanced 3.5-liter V6 with direct and port injection producing 278 horsepower, paired with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and technology, featuring a standard GoPro mount on the windshield (reflecting the active lifestyle focus of many owners), touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone integration, and improved ergonomics, though maintaining a purposeful, function-oriented character. Off-road capability remained a key selling point with the TRD Off-Road and flagship TRD Pro models offering specialized suspensions, terrain management systems, and enhanced underbody protection. The composite bed continued as a distinctive feature, with the addition of a 120V outlet and adjustable tie-down cleats in many models. Safety technology expanded dramatically with the Toyota Safety Sense P suite becoming standard across the range in 2018, offering pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, lane departure alert, automatic high beams, and dynamic radar cruise control—advanced features for the midsize truck segment at the time. Throughout its production run, this generation received periodic updates including enhanced infotainment with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa capability, additional special editions including the Trail and Nightshade variants, and revised color and package options. The third-generation Tacoma maintained the model's dominance in the revitalized midsize truck segment despite strong new competition, continuing to attract buyers with its proven reliability, exceptional off-road capability, strong resale value, and balanced approach to combining work utility with lifestyle-oriented features."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (N400)"
    start_year: 2024
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation Toyota Tacoma represents the most comprehensive redesign in the model's history, built on Toyota's TNGA-F platform shared with the full-size Tundra and global Land Cruiser series. Available in extended cab and crew cab configurations with multiple bed lengths, the new Tacoma features evolutionary styling that maintains its muscular, off-road ready appearance while incorporating more modern elements including C-shaped LED signature lighting, a larger grille, and more pronounced fender bulges. A significant engineering change is the transition from leaf springs to a coil spring rear suspension across all models, providing improved ride quality and handling without compromising capability. Powertrain options include a new 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder in multiple states of tune, from 228 horsepower in base models to 278 horsepower in mid-grade variants, while the higher-end configurations feature a hybrid-assisted i-FORCE MAX version producing 326 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque—the most powerful Tacoma ever offered. Transmission options include an eight-speed automatic or six-speed manual in certain trims, maintaining an option increasingly rare in modern trucks. The interior represents a dramatic improvement with higher quality materials, more sophisticated design, and significantly enhanced technology including a standard 8-inch or available 14-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital gauge cluster, and wireless smartphone integration. Off-road capability remains a core focus with up to seven distinct off-road focused grades including the Trail, TRD Off-Road, TRD Pro, and new Trailhunter, the latter developed specifically for overlanding enthusiasts with factory-installed features like high-performance Fox internal bypass shocks, a high-mounted air intake, and integrated recovery points. Safety technology is comprehensive with Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 standard across all trims, offering pre-collision system with motorcycle detection, dynamic radar cruise control, lane departure alert, and proactive driving assist. The fourth-generation Tacoma aims to maintain the model's leadership in the midsize truck segment by significantly improving refinement, technology, and efficiency while preserving the reliability, durability, and off-road capability that has defined the nameplate."
